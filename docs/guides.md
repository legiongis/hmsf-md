## Create a new Scout (admin instructions)

1. Log in as `admin` and go to the admin interface, https://hms.fpan.us/admin
2. Find **Scouts** under the HMS section, and go to **+ Add Scout**
3. In the top section, fill out the following fields:
    - **Password** (doesn't matter what it is, you will need to reset it below)
    - **First Name**
    - **Last Name** 
    - **Email address**
    - **Middle initial**
    - **Username** - Follow this format for consistency: first initial, middle initial, last name. For example, Biff A Hooper would be `bahooper`.
        - It would be best to check ahead that this username doesn't already exist in the system. If it does, add `2`, `3`, etc. (Typically, this is handled via the signup form submission.)
4. In the bottom "Scout Profile" section, fill out any fields you want.
5. Save Scout.
6. Now, go back to the main admin page, and click the **Users** link near the top. This is a list of all user accounts on the site. Find and edit the new user you created.
7. In the edit page, you should see **Invalid password format or unknown hashing algorithm** in the password field. Use the provided link to change the password to something that you can send to the user.
